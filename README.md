# Mario Texture Pack
My Mario Geometry Dash texture pack!

<img src="assets/logo.png">

# v1
I made this texture pack a month ago but since then, I haven't had any time to make a video for it. After recording a video for this texture pack last night, when I was about to put in a video editor, I realised it had no sound! Luckily I still had a couple of shorter recordings that I made for previews when I was still making the texture pack. Although the previews don't have the exact same music and textures as the texture pack has now, because those previews were recorded when I was still creating the texture pack.

The icon textures didn't turn out very well (the super mushroom was pretty good though). It took me a long time to find the resources for the music and textures.
